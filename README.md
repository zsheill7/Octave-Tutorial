## Guide to Common Octave Commands

<p>I learned all of this from Andrew Ng's course on Coursera - be sure to check it out if you want to learn more!</p>

<p>If you have not yet downloaded Octave, use the following link:<p>
<a href = "https://sourceforge.net/projects/octave/files/Octave%20MacOSX%20Binary/2013-12-30%20binary%20installer%20of%20Octave%203.8.0%20for%20OSX%2010.9.1%20%28beta%29/GNU_Octave_3.8.0-6.dmg/download">Octave Download</a>

<h2>Basic operations</h2>
<p>Note: Do not enter the ">>".  This is just a prompt. </p>


```

>> 5+6
ans = 11
>> 3-2
ans = 1
>> 4*3
ans = 12
>> 2/3
ans = 0.66667
>> 2*5
ans = 32

```

<h2>Boolean Operations</h2>
<p>Octave can also be used to handle boolean operations.  Octave uses 0 for false and 1 for true </p>

```

>> 1 == 2
ans = 0
>> 1 == 1
ans = 1
>> 1 && 2
>> ans = 0
1 || 0 
>> ans = 1


```
<h2></h2>
<p>The default prompt is octave:1>, but you can change this default prompt with the following command: </p>

```

PS1('>> ');

```

The string in quotes will be the new default prompt.
<h2>Assigning variables</h2>

<p></p>

```
>> a = 2
a = 3
```

You can make sure the console doesn't print any output by including semicolons

```
>> a = 2;
```

<h2></h2>
<p>Then, print the variable by typing it in. </p>

```
>> a
a = 2
```

<p>Print out numbers with a certain number of decimal places with the following command:</p>

```
disp(sprintf('2 decimals: %0.2f', a))
```

<p>Change the format of decimals with the following command</p>

```
>> format short
>> format long
```

<h2>Matrices</h2>
<p>You can create matrices using the following commands.  Semicolons separate rows:</p>

```
>> A = [1 2; 3 4; 5 6] 
A = 

  1   2
  3   4
  5   6
  
>> A = [1 2;
> 3 4;
> 5 6]

A = 

  1   2
  3   4
  5   6
  
```

<h2></h2>
<p>You can also create vectors (matrices with only one column)</p>

```
v = [1; 2; 3]
v =
  1
  2
  3
  
```
  <p>The code below initializes a matrix with numbers from 1 to 2, incremented by 0.2. </p>

```
  
>> 1:0.2:2 

ans =

    1.0000    1.2000    1.4000    1.6000    1.8000    2.0000
    
 >>v = 1:6
 v =

   1   2   3   4   5   6
```

<h2></h2>
<p>You can also perform matrix operations:</p>

```
>> ones(2,3)
ans =

   1   1   1
   1   1   1

>> C = 2*ones(2,3)
C =

   2   2   2
   2   2   2


>> w = zeros(1,3)
w =

   0   0   0

```

<p>You can also use random values to generate a matrix:</p>

```

>> w = rand(1,3)
w =

   0.78627   0.52859   0.11786

>> rand(3,3)
ans =

   0.21298   0.86839   0.94668
   0.50902   0.95247   0.34806
   0.80769   0.55453   0.56063

```

<p>Identity Matrix:</p>

```
>> eye(4)
ans =

Diagonal Matrix

   1   0   0   0
   0   1   0   0
   0   0   1   0
   0   0   0   1
```
